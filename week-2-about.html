            <p class="p-text">The Akan people of Ghana frequently name their children after the day of the week they were born and the 
              order in which they were born. These "day names" have further meanings concerning the soul and character of the person. Middle
               names have considerably more variety and can refer to their birth order, twin status, or an ancestor's middle name. <em>Akan Name Generator</em> is a web application that
                 uses the same idea, where it takes your birthday and calculates the day of the week you were born and
                depending on their gender using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akan_names"><b>Akan Names</b></a> . In
                the culture of the Akan people of Ghana,
                they name their children after the day of the week in regardness of the soul and character of that
                particular person who is born.
